Exploiting the arrangement of railroad tracks in northern cities, we explore the extent to which segregation impacts homicide victimization by race. Our results reveal a robust positive relationship between segregation and non-white homicide victimization. In addition, we find a decrease in public provisions, as highly segregated locations generate fewer revenues and have lower public expenditures. Our findings suggest that white flight and segregation deplete the local tax base, leading to urban decay and higher crime, resulting in the loss of non-white lives.
